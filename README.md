# Coherent Structures in atmopsheric boundary layers in Large Eddy Simulations
__This project aims to characterize coherent structures in LES.__  
Git project creation in 2019  


The routines have been used in a peer-reviewed article :

## Description

### Main directory
The main repository contains this __README.md__ file and XX folders: __rename_netcdf__ and __scripts__.

The main script is __exec_step.exe__, run as *./exec_step.exe 1 1 1 1 1*
It calls the following routines:
